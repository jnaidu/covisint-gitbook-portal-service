# Managing Sites
Sites are the basic unit for creating content in the content management system.  Each site has a discrete set of assets (pages, documents, etc.) that are managed by a set of site roles that can be granted to users for that site.  When using sites, it's important to understand the basic concepts:

## Organization
An Organization is the portal construct for giving a hierarchical structure to sites affiliated with companies

## Site
A site is the basic unit for content management and collaboration.

### Site Types
* Open – Users can join or leave sites without any approval required.
* Restricted – Users request access to sites and access is granted by a Site administrator
* Private – Users can access Private Sites by invitation only – NOTE that sites in the POC are all built as Private Sites

### Site Content
Each site has an independent set of content:
* Web Content
* Documents and Media
* Blog
* Wiki
* Forum
* Knowledge Base
* Local taxonomy
* Site Pages

### Site Roles
Each Site has an independent set of users that can be granted granular access to Site content.
* Site Administrator – Site administrator is a standard role across all sites that has omni-administrative privileges for a Site, including content administration, page and site administration, and user access administration
* Site Member – Site member is a standard role across all sites with basic access to authenticated site content
* Site Teams – Site Teams are ad hoc roles that can be created on an individual site
