# Targeting Content
This section describes the different ways to introduce a piece of web content into an environment, based on the business rules and the model that is configured in the POC. There are several ways to deliver content:
1. Publish content on a single page that is displayed to all users
2. Publish content on a page that is displayed to users of just one customer
3. Publish content on a page that is displayed to users based on context
4. Publish content on a page based on personalization or preference
5. Publish content that can appear on one page, then downstream content managers can choose to display the content in a site or modify the content before it is displayed
6. Content is secured so that only one or more groups or roles can see the content
