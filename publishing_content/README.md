# Publishing Content
This section illustrates how to add a portlet, and other types of content. You can upload three types of contents via a LAR file 1) Web Content 2) Documents and Media, and 3) Entire Site. Be careful not to confuse portlet-specific .lar files with site-specific .lar files.

## Adding a Portlet
Users can be granted different roles that have the ability to place one or more portlets on a page.  In addition, Pages can be configured so that specific roles can only place portlets on a specific section of a page.  We also have the ability to add preconfigured portlets to a library, from which the portlets can be dropped on a page.
